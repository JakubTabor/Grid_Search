# Grid_Search
I gonna show how to search for best parameters in your model, with different examples
# I gonna use different model with hyperparameters and my training data will be iris data
# So first i import datasets and load iris data from datasets
# Then I put iris data into pandas Dataframe and set columns as features of iris and set flower column as my target column
# Then I apply on target column names of flowers, my data is read, I have names of flowers and their features and all is labeled
# Now I import train_test_split and get train and test set, I use iris.data as X and iris.target as y
