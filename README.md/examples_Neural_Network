# Now I gonna build a Neural Network to deal with this task
# I gonna search for the best parameters and write plot function to plot on graph all results
# So I define my function, which will plot on graph history of my model, I will plot it with "subplots"
# First I definne "loss" of my model from history, then "validation loss" during the training
# Then named (x axis and y axis) as (Epoch and Binary crossentropy)
# Secound plot will be with (accuracy and validation accuracy) and also I named (x axis and y axis) as (Epoch and Accuracy)
# Now when I have defined plot function I import tensorflow to build my model
# I create function "train_model" and pass inside (X_train, y_train for training)
# I pass also "num_nodes", so (neurons to define them later), I do exactly this same with (dropout_prob, to pass numbers later) 
# And also I pass "learning rate" to specify later values, as well as "batch size" and "epochs"
