# Now I gonna build a Neural Network to deal with this task
# I gonna search for the best parameters and write plot function to plot on graph all results
# So I define my function, which will plot on graph history of my model, I will plot it with "subplots"
# First I definne "loss" of my model from history, then "validation loss" during the training
# Then named (x axis and y axis) as (Epoch and Binary crossentropy)
