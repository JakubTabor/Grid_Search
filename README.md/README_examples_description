# I gonna show some examples how to use GridSearchCV, on more complicated dataset and also check performance of some model and Neural Network
# First I load my dataset and pass columns for better description, class (g and h) are gamma and hadron
# Then I map my columns class into numeric variables, one for gamma and zero for hadron
# Next I gonna plot columns to see how my data is distributed, I can see very different distribution only in column "fAlpha"
# In other cases distribution is pretty much the same, with exception on "fLength", "fAsym" and "fM3Long"
# Now I gonna split my data into train, test and valid sets, I use for it numpy split, first shuffling samples
# First split will be on 60% of my data and next of 80% of my data, than I check size of my classes, I see that there is imbalance
# I gonna use over sampling method, so I import "RandomOverSampler", next I create function that will oversample my data and scale them
