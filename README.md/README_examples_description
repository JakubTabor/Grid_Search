# I gonna show some examples how to use GridSearchCV, on more complicated dataset and also check performance of some model and Neural Network
# First I load my dataset and pass columns for better description, class (g and h) are gamma and hadron
# Then I map my columns class into numeric variables, one for gamma and zero for hadron
# Next I gonna plot columns to see how my data is distributed, I can see very different distribution only in column "fAlpha"
# In other cases distribution is pretty much the same, with exception on "fLength", "fAsym" and "fM3Long"
