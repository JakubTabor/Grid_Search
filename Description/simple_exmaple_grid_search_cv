# Grid_Search
* I gonna show how to search for best parameters in your model, with different examples

# I gonna use different model with hyperparameters and my training data will be iris data
* So first i import datasets and load iris data from datasets
* Then I put iris data into pandas Dataframe and set columns as features of iris and set flower column as my target column
* Then I apply on target column names of flowers, my data is read, I have names of flowers and their features and all is labeled

# Now I import train_test_split and get train and test set, I use iris.data as X and iris.target as y
* Then I import GridSearchCV which is the model to search for best parameters
* And I gonna import also models for training, (svm, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression)
* Now I gonna save models params, so I put some parameters and GridSearchCV will check every combination and return the best

# First i set model name, then put model itself and finally parameters, I do it for my three models
* When I have all "model_params" prepared, I can implement "GridSearchCV" 
* So I start with create list for scores, than I start for loop for model names and model parameters in my saved params, with access to items
* Then I create object of GridSearchCV puting inside models and parameters, then cv parameter, where i epecify number of folds
* I set "return_train_score to False", so it will not include training scores

# Then I train GridSearchCV with (iris.data and iris.target), And not I choose which parameters will append in my list 
* So I choose first model name, then best score which I get using "best_score_ from my model" and also best parameters using "best_params_ from my model"
* I put my data into pd.DataFrame and pass previous filled scores list and columns for better description
* And I get each model with best score and best parameters, scores are pretty high, but my data was not so complicated

# This is a common technique when you search for best parameters for your model, I put only few parameters buy there are lot of parameters which you can check
* Searching for best model and best parameters is an trail and error tehnic, You need to give different parameters to your model
* And some parameters are not compatible with others, This is powerfull tehnic which can be used in every project to find best performance of your model
